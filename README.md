# BICAN Specimen Portal Metadata
This repository contains meta data that drive the implementation of BICAN specimen portal.

BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) intends to adopt scalable technology platforms and streamlined sampling strategies and assay cascade to create comprehensive and highly granular brain cell atlases in human, non-human primates, mouse, and other species.

Coordinating Unit for Biostatistics, Informatics, and Engagement (CUBIE) are to (i) enable the exploration of large-scale brain cell atlas data and knowledge, and inspire research in brain function and disorders; and (ii) ensure research rigor and data reproducibility by making the data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), and the process transparent. An application is expected to propose only one of the above four respective elements.

In this repository, we will release the meta data developed from the collaboration of GQGroup from UTHealth and other domain experts including but not limited to Drs. Ed Lein, John Campos, Dirk Keene, and Lydia Ng.

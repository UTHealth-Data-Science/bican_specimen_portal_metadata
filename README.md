This repository is no longer managed. You may access the current metadata directly from NIMP using the Terminology Browser.

Once you login to NIMP, the Terminology Browser can be accessed from the top-level menu item “Resource Explorer.” The metadata is displayed in a table as well as a tree structure. Metadata can be searched from the search boxes provided in both the interfaces. In addition, metadata can be downloaded from the "Export to CSV" button in the Table view.

For further information on how to use the terminology browser, please refer the NIMP user guide at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ll_pbPXPak46cb8VNKX7osnF2LRfW6o5/edit#heading=h.3c9z6hx
